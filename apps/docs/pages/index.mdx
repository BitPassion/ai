Vercel AI Utils is **a compact library for building edge-rendered AI-powered streaming text and chat UIs**. It takes care of the boilerplate code while not adding any additional abstraction or indirection between you and your AI model provider's SDK.

## Features

- Edge Runtime compatibility
- First-class support for native OpenAI, Anthropic, and HuggingFace Inference JavaScript SDKs
- SWR-powered React hooks for fetching and rendering streaming text responses
- Callbacks for saving completed streaming responses to a database (in the same request)
