  An open source library for building AI-powered streaming user interfaces.
</div>

Vercel AI Connector is a compact library for building edge-rendered AI-powered streaming text and chat user interfaces. It takes care of the boilerplate streaming code and data fetching codewithout adding additional abstraction between you and your AI model provider's SDK. It also provides a set of React components for rendering the results in common UI patterns such as text completion and chat.
